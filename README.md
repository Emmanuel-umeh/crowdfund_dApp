## About
This is a dApp that allows users to crowdfund for their various projects

## Features
- Users can create(list) a project to be crowdfunded
- Users can fund projects that are listed
- Project owners can withdraw funds once the project target has been reached
- Project owners can close funding for their projects: This will result in the project owners being unable to withdraw the funds and funders can request for refunds if this occurs

#### Areas that can be improved
- Limits can be placed on how much project owners can contribute to their own projects
